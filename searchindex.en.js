Frontend server-side applications can be protected by Authorization Code Flow (also with PKCE), during which several redirection steps take place. For protecting APIs you can use Client Credentials Grant to avoid redirections steps involved in authorization code flow you have to use --no-redirects=true. For frontend applications you can use Authorization Code Flow (also with PKCE) with encrypted refresh token cookies enabled, in this case however you have to handle redirections, e.g. at token expiration.\nDefault Deny --enable-default-deny - option blocks all requests without valid token on all basic HTTP methods, (DELETE, GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PATCH, POST, PUT, TRACE). WARNING: There are no additional requirements on the token, it isn’t checked for some claims or roles, groups etc…(this is by default true)\n--enable-default-deny-strict (recommended) - option blocks all requests (including valid token) unless specific path with requirements specified in resources (this option is by default false)\nUpstream Host Proxy and OpenID Provider Proxy By default the communication with the OpenID provider is direct. If you wish, you can specify a forwarding proxy server in your configuration file:\nopenid-provider-proxy: http://proxy.example.com:8080 or you can use standard env variables: HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, NO_PROXY\nBy default also communication with upstream is direct, if you would like to use proxy server to forward traffic upstream you can use configuration file:\nupstream-proxy: http://proxy.example.com:8080 upstream-no-proxy: http://donotproxy.example.com:8080 or corresponding env variables: PROXY_UPSTREAM_PROXY, PROXY_UPSTREAM_NO_PROXY\nHTTP routing By default, all requests will be proxied on to the upstream, if you wish to ensure all requests are authenticated you can use this:\n--resources=uri=/* # note, unless specified the method is assumed to be 'any|ANY' The HTTP routing rules follow the guidelines from chi. The ordering of the resources does not matter, the router will handle that for you.\nCookies size All browsers have limitations on cookies number and cookie size. This usually does not adhere to any standard. E.g. Chrome has limitation of 4096 bytes on all cookies per domain. This might cause you troubles e.g. Chrome responding with 431 Request Header Fields are Too Large. To overcome this limitations gatekeeper offers several options:\n--enable-id-token-cookie - is set by default false, in case you don’t need id token, leave it/turn it off --store-url - this will enable storing of refresh token in redis store, instead of cookies, which saves you some bytes, also has some additional effect of raising security on client side as refresh token won’t be exposed on client side\nSession-only cookies By default, the access and refresh cookies are session-only and disposed of on browser close; you can disable this feature using the --enable-session-cookies option.\nCookie Names There are two parameters which you can use to set up cookie names for access token and refresh token.\n--cookie-access-name=myAccessTokenCookie --cookie-refresh-name=myRefreshTokenCookie Allowed Query Params for Authentication Sometimes you may want to pass some query params to IDP e.g. kc_idp_hint or ui_locales etc…Gatekeeper provides param allowed-query-params where you can specify which query params will be forwarded to IDP\nThis example will allow passing myparam and yourparam with any value to IDP:\n--allowed-query-params=\"myparam\" \\ --allowed-query-params=\"yourparam\" yaml example:\nallowed-query-params: myparam: \"\" yourparam: \"\" This example will allow passing myparam and yourparam only with specified value:\n--allowed-query-params=\"myparam=myvalue\" \\ --allowed-query-params=\"yourparam=yourvalue\" yaml example:\nallowed-query-params: myparam: \"myvalue\" yourparam: \"yourvalue\" If you would like to have defaults for your parameters, there is default-allowed-query-params option available, these values will be used only when there are no params specified in url:\nNOTE: Params present in default query params must be allowed by allowed-query-params option\ncli example:\n--default-allowed-query-params=\"myparam=myvalue\" \\ --default-allowed-query-params=\"yourparam=yourvalue\" yaml example:\ndefault-allowed-query-params: myparam: \"myvalue\" yourparam: \"yourvalue\" TCP proxy with HTTP CONNECT You can protect your TCP services with gogatekeeper by adding CONNECT HTTP method to list of custom-http-methods. On client side you will need to pass of course token in Authorization header (righ now there are few clients which could make HTTP connect with Bearer token and then forward tcp, e.g. gost proxy - but only in static way, some IDE provide HTTP CONNECT functionality for db connectors but only with Basic authentication, we would like to add this functionality to gatekeeper in future). This setup will authenticate connection at start and will create tunnel to your backend service. Please use with care and ensure that it allows connection only to intended services, otherwise it can be missused for various attacks.\nThis example allows users with valid token to connect to backend postgres service:\n\"--discovery-url=http://127.0.0.1:8081/realms/test/.well-known/openid-configuration\", \"--client-id=test-client\", \"--client-secret=6447d0c0-d510-42a7-b654-6e3a16b2d7e2\", \"--upstream-url=http://127.0.0.1:5432\", \"--listen=0.0.0.0:5000\", \"--no-redirects=true\", \"--enable-authorization-header=true\", \"--custom-http-methods=CONNECT\", \"--enable-default-deny=true\", \"--enable-logging=true\", \"--enable-compression=true\", \"--enable-json-logging=true\", \"--verbose=true\", \"--skip-token-verification=false\", \"--upstream-keepalive-timeout=30s\", \"--scopes=openid\", \"--skip-access-token-clientid-check=true\" Configuration for gost proxy, to forward your tcp client connection with HTTP CONNECT, please be aware that you need to input there your token (there is only example token in this config):\ncat \u003e config.yaml \u003c\u003cEOF services: - name: service-0 addr: \":8000\" handler: type: tcp chain: chain-0 listener: type: tcp chains: - name: chain-0 hops: - name: hop-0 nodes: - name: localhost addr: :5000 connector: type: http metadata: header: Authorization: \"Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCIgOiAiSldUIiwia2lkIiA6ICJndWZUNUxaOWROWE5QSHV1d2U3T3AwWnI3b0VqdjhqVzdzbF8xUU1jaUkwIn0.eyJleHAiOjE2ODY1NzI1MDEsImlhdCI6MTY4NjU3MjIwMSwianRpIjoiY2UyZmRkMjAtNTc1YS00ZjIyLThkYTktOWQxYjM0ZTE3YjE3IiwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cDov LzEyNy4wLjAuMTo4MDgxL3JlYWxtcy90ZXN0IiwiYXVkIjoiYWNjb3VudCIsInN1YiI6ImE2NzgyMzg4LTNjOTMtNDA4Ny1iNDk5LTI5MmViYTU2ZDYwNiIsInR5cCI6IkJlYXJlciIsImF6cCI6InRlc3QtY2xpZW50Iiwic2Vzc2lvbl9zdGF0ZSI6ImRhODlmMDU4LTAyOGItNGJlNS05ZmQ4LTg5MjBmOTRkZTEwNiIsImFsbG93ZWQtb3JpZ2lucyI6WyIqIl0 sInJlYWxtX2FjY2VzcyI6eyJyb2xlcyI6WyJvZmZsaW5lX2FjY2VzcyIsInVtYV9hdXRob3JpemF0aW9uIiwidXNlciJdfSwicmVzb3VyY2VfYWNjZXNzIjp7ImFjY291bnQiOnsicm9sZXMiOlsibWFuYWdlLWFjY291bnQiLCJ2aWV3LXByb2ZpbGUiXX19LCJzY29wZSI6Im9wZW5pZCBlbWFpbCBwcm9maWxlIiwic2lkIjoiZGE4OWYwNTgtMDI4Yi00YmU1LT lmZDgtODkyMGY5NGRlMTA2IiwiZW1haWxfdmVyaWZpZWQiOnRydWUsIm5hbWUiOiJUZXN0IFRlc3QiLCJwcmVmZXJyZWRfdXNlcm5hbWUiOiJteXVzZXIiLCJnaXZlbl9uYW1lIjoiVGVzdCIsImZhbWlseV9uYW1lIjoiVGVzdCIsImVtYWlsIjoic29tZWJvZHlAc29tZXdoZXJlLmNvbSJ9.D-qDEDBumfIsVRJY6ONaXAY6fZWKZhrTG9-qtaSxYZIq7TLfApKh ZCdLTkNzZPDSuL7FugJ7AGnwnmbRos9hOV25UgqAZ9biO2eo04olwXXsn7q0cboVqQXMlFc4kNCWQJov9JqhG_f21T25gdQH7eMlSu1QvnKvvTRQNEHpG9fvL86D16GETPnVExRoH81fe0zHMQPk7u_eZcOlNxg5HDFacNSUpnpgoH37Fhzt0FHj5mN_nfknty5KLCO6Zs_kmdvlgVkPzceZqp2Chmq4rmlp9OPMslTEwBlRn1qTRZPpJXCxoLuMMNMeVvrXXKvFXuI uQ7vZFOE8xNVogm7cxQ\" dialer: type: tcp EOF start gost proxy:\ngost -C config.yaml Connect with psql client:\npsql -U postgres -h localhost -p 8000 Websocket proxy You can protect also websocket servers with gatekeeper proxy. You must use standard upgrade headers to proxy to your websocket backend. There are additional considerations you need to take into account when protecting websocket backend. Browsers doesn’t have built-in protection against CORS for websocket protocol like they have for HTTP. That means you need to consider enabling additional methods for verifying that browsers connect only to your backend and receives response only from your backend. For this we recommend to turn-on --enable-encrypted-token and --encryption-key options and also verify Origin header with headers matching, please refer to Headers matching.\nHMAC Signature, signing and verification For raising your security you can verify/sign HMAC for your requests. Signing can be done when using --enable-hmac with forward signing feature below. Verification is done when using gatekeeper as authentication/authorization proxy. Gatekeeper in forward-signing mode creates signature, this is also signature which gatekeeper expects when used as auth/authz proxy, you can create this signature on your own, assuming you have proper secret. Signature is passed in X-HMAC-SHA256 header. Signature is created by signing several fields:\nstringToSign := fmt.Sprintf( \"%s\\n%s%s\\n%s;%s;%s\", req.Method, req.URL.Path, req.URL.RawQuery, req.Header.Get(constant.AuthorizationHeader), req.Host, sha256.Sum256(body), ) Forward-signing proxy Forward-signing provides a mechanism for authentication and authorization between services using tokens issued from the IdP. When operating in this mode the proxy will automatically acquire an access token (handling the refreshing or logins on your behalf) and tag outbound requests with an Authorization header. You can control which domains are tagged with the --forwarding-domains option. Note, this option uses a contains comparison on domains. So, if you wanted to match all domains under *.svc.cluster.local you can use: --forwarding-domain=svc.cluster.local.\nYou can choose between two types of OAuth authentications: password grant type (default) or client_credentials grant type.\nExample setup password grant:\nYou have a collection of micro-services which are permitted to speak to one another; you have already set up the credentials, roles, and clients in Keycloak, providing granular role controls over issue tokens.\n- name: gatekeeper image: quay.io/gogatekeeper/gatekeeper:2.14.2 args: - --enable-forwarding=true - --forwarding-username=projecta - --forwarding-password=some_password - --forwarding-domains=projecta.svc.cluster.local - --forwarding-domains=projectb.svc.cluster.local - --client-id=xxxxxx - --client-secret=xxxx - --discovery-url=http://keycloak:8080/realms/master - --tls-ca-certificate=/etc/secrets/ca.pem - --tls-ca-key=/etc/secrets/ca-key.pem # Note: if you don't specify any forwarding domains, all domains will be signed; Also the code checks is the # domain 'contains' the value (it's not a regex) so if you wanted to sign all requests to svc.cluster.local, just use # svc.cluster.local volumeMounts: - name: keycloak-socket mountPoint: /var/run/keycloak - name: projecta image: some_images Example setup client credentials grant:\n- name: gatekeeper image: quay.io/gogatekeeper/gatekeeper:2.14.2 args: - --enable-forwarding=true - --forwarding-domains=projecta.svc.cluster.local - --forwarding-domains=projectb.svc.cluster.local - --client-id=xxxxxx - --client-secret=xxxx - --discovery-url=http://keycloak:8080/realms/master - --tls-ca-certificate=/etc/secrets/ca.pem - --tls-ca-key=/etc/secrets/ca-key.pem - --forwarding-grant-type=client_credentials # Note: if you don't specify any forwarding domains, all domains will be signed; Also the code checks is the # domain 'contains' the value (it's not a regex) so if you wanted to sign all requests to svc.cluster.local, just use # svc.cluster.local volumeMounts: - name: keycloak-socket mountPoint: /var/run/keycloak - name: projecta image: some_images Test the forward proxy:\ncurl -k --proxy http://127.0.0.1:3000 https://test.projesta.svc.cluster.local On the receiver side, you could set up the Gatekeeper Proxy --no-redirects=true and permit this to verify and handle admission for you. Alternatively, the access token can found as a bearer token in the request.\nForwarding signed HTTPS connections Handling HTTPS requires a man-in-the-middle sort of TLS connection. By default, if no --tls-ca-certificate and --tls-ca-key are provided the proxy will use the default certificate. If you wish to verify the trust, you’ll need to generate a CA, for example.\n$ openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey ed2551 -keyout ca.key -out ca.pem $ bin/gatekeeper \\ --enable-forwarding \\ --forwarding-username=USERNAME \\ --forwarding-password=PASSWORD \\ --client-id=CLIENT_ID \\ --client-secret=SECRET \\ --discovery-url=https://keycloak.example.com/realms/test \\ --tls-ca-certificate=ca.pem \\ --tls-ca-key=ca-key.pem Forwarding with UMA token When --enable-uma is set in forwarding mode, proxy signs request with RPT token\nHTTPS redirect The proxy supports an HTTP listener, so the only real requirement here is to perform an HTTP → HTTPS redirect. You can enable the option like this:\n--listen-http=127.0.0.1:80 --enable-security-filter=true # is required for the https redirect --enable-https-redirection Let’s Encrypt configuration Here is an example of the required configuration for Let’s Encrypt support:\nlisten: 0.0.0.0:443 enable-https-redirection: true enable-security-filter: true use-letsencrypt: true letsencrypt-cache-dir: ./cache/ redirection-url: https://domain.tld:443/ hostnames: - domain.tld Listening on port 443 is mandatory.\nAccess token encryption By default, the session token is placed into a cookie in plaintext. If you prefer to encrypt the session cookie, use the --enable-encrypted-token and --encryption-key options. Note that the access token forwarded in the X-Auth-Token header to upstream is unaffected.\nBearer token passthrough If your Bearer token is intended for your upstream application and not for gatekeeper you can use option --skip-authorization-header-identity. Please be aware that token is still required to be in cookies.\nUpstream headers On protected resources, the upstream endpoint will receive a number of headers added by the proxy, along with custom claims, like this:\nX-Auth-Email X-Auth-ExpiresIn X-Auth-Groups X-Auth-Roles X-Auth-Subject X-Auth-Token X-Auth-Userid X-Auth-Username To control the Authorization header use the enable-authorization-header YAML configuration or the --enable-authorization-header command line option. By default, this option is set to true.\nCustom claim headers You can inject additional claims from the access token into the upstream headers with the --add-claims option. For example, a token from a Keycloak provider might include the following claims:\n\"resource_access\": {}, \"name\": \"Beloved User\", \"preferred_username\": \"beloved.user\", \"given_name\": \"Beloved\", \"family_name\": \"User\", \"email\": \"beloved@example.com\" In order to request you receive the given_name, family_name, and name in the authentication header, we would add --add-claims=given_name and --add-claims=family_name and so on, or we can do it in the configuration file, like this:\nadd-claims: - given_name - family_name - name This would add the additional headers to the authenticated request along with standard ones.\nX-Auth-Family-Name: User X-Auth-Given-Name: Beloved X-Auth-Name: Beloved User Custom headers You can inject custom headers using the --headers=\"name=value\" option or the configuration file:\nheaders: name: value OpenID provider headers In some cases you might need to send headers to your OpenId provider discovery endpoint (e.g. you have your endpoint protected by basic auth). For this use cases there is --openid-provider-headers option:\nopenid-provider-headers: - X-SEND: \"MYVALUE\" - X-OTHER-SEND: \"NEXT VALUE\" --openid-provider-headers=\"myheader1=value1\" \\ --openid-provider-headers=\"myheader2=value2\" Encryption key In order to remain stateless and not have to rely on a central cache to persist the refresh_tokens, the refresh token is encrypted and added as a cookie using crypto/aes. The key must be the same if you are running behind a load balancer. The key length should be either 16 or 32 bytes, depending or whether you want AES-128 or AES-256.\nClaim matching The proxy supports adding a variable list of claim matches against the presented tokens for additional access control. You can match the ‘iss’ or ‘aud’ to the token or custom attributes; each of the matches are regexes. For example, --match-claims 'aud=sso.*' or --claim iss=https://.*' or via the configuration file, like this:\nmatch-claims: aud: openvpn iss: https://keycloak.example.com/realms/commons or via the CLI, like this:\n--match-claims=auth=openvpn --match-claims=iss=http://keycloak.example.com/realms/commons You can limit the email domain permitted; for example, if you want to limit to only users on the example.com domain:\nmatch-claims: email: ^.*@example.com$ The adapter supports matching on multi-value strings claims. The match will succeed if one of the values matches, for example:\nmatch-claims: perms: perm1 will successfully match\n{ \"iss\": \"https://sso.example.com\", \"sub\": \"\", \"perms\": [\"perm1\", \"perm2\"] } Group claims You can match on the group claims within a token via the groups parameter available within the resource. While roles are implicitly required, such as roles=admin,user where the user MUST have roles ‘admin’ AND ‘user’, groups are applied with an OR operation, so groups=users,testers requires that the user MUST be within either ‘users’ OR ’testers’. The claim name is hard-coded to groups, so a JWT token would look like this:\n{ \"iss\": \"https://sso.example.com\", \"sub\": \"\", \"aud\": \"test\", \"exp\": 1515269245, \"iat\": 1515182845, \"email\": \"beloved@example.com\", \"groups\": [ \"group_one\", \"group_two\" ], \"name\": \"Beloved\" } Headers matching You can match on the request headers via the headers parameter available within the resource. Headers are implicitly required, such as headers=x-some-header:somevalue,x-other-header:othervalue where the request MUST have headers ‘x-some-header’ with value ‘somevalue’ AND ‘x-other-header’, with value ‘othervalue’.\nForward-auth Traefik, nginx ingress and other gateways usually have feature called forward-auth. This enables them to forward request to external auth/authz service which returns 2xx in case auth/authz was successful and otherwise some higher code (usually 401/403) or redirects them for authentication to keycloak server. You can use gatekeeper as this external auth/authz service by using headers matching feature as describe above and enabling --no-proxy option (this option will not forward request to upstream).\nExample:\ntraefik forward-auth configuration when you don’t want to redirect user to authentication server by gatekeeper (useful for e.g. API authentication or when you are using redirect to keycloak server on front proxy)\napiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1 kind: Middleware metadata: labels: app.kubernetes.io/name: dashboard-apis-oauth app.kubernetes.io/part-of: dashboard name: dashboard-apis-oauth namespace: censored spec: forwardAuth: address: http://gatekeeper-dns-name:4180 gatekeeper configuration\n- args: - --client-id=dashboard - --no-redirects=true # this option will ensure there will be no redirects - --no-proxy=true # this option will ensure that request will be not forwarded to upstream - --listen=0.0.0.0:4180 - --discovery-url=https://keycloak-dns-name/realms/censored - --enable-default-deny=true # this option will ensure protection of all paths /*, according our traefik config, traefik will send it to / - --resources=headers=x-some-header:somevalue,x-other-header:othervalue traefik forward-auth configuration when you WANT to redirect user to authentication server by gatekeeper (useful for e.g. frontend application authentication). Please be aware that in this mode you need to forward headers X-Forwarded-Host, X-Forwarded-Uri, X-Forwarded-Proto, from front proxy to gatekeeper. You can find more complete example here.\nNOTE: Please very important is to forward prefix (means all paths with prefix) /oauth directly to gatekeeper service as you can see in manifest, otherwise you will see redirect loop.\nIMPORTANT: Please ensure that you are receiving headers only from trusted proxy and gatekeeper is not exposed directly to internet, otherwise attacker might misuse this!\napiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1 kind: Middleware metadata: labels: app.kubernetes.io/name: dashboard-apis-oauth app.kubernetes.io/part-of: dashboard name: dashboard-apis-oauth namespace: censored spec: forwardAuth: address: http://gatekeeper-dns-name:4180 gatekeeper configuration:\n- args: - --client-id=dashboard - --no-redirects=false # this option will ensure there WILL BE redirects to keycloak server - --no-proxy=true # this option will ensure that request will be not forwarded to upstream - --listen=0.0.0.0:4180 - --discovery-url=https://keycloak-dns-name/realms/censored - --enable-default-deny=true # this option will ensure protection of all paths /*, according our traefik config, traefik will send it to / - --resources=headers=x-some-header:somevalue,x-other-header:othervalue in some cases you maybe use traefik without k8s, here is example traefik configuration, no k8s resources:\nhttp: routers: app: entryPoints: - \"websecure\" rule: \"Host(`domain.org`)\" middlewares: - \"app-middleware\" - \"app-headers\" tls: certResolver: letsencrypt service: app-service app-proxy: entryPoints: - \"websecure\" rule: \"Host(`domain.org`) \u0026\u0026 PathPrefix(`/oauth`)\" # here you see that /oauth prefix is routed directly to gatekeeper tls: certResolver: letsencrypt service: app-proxy ################ middlewares: app-headers: headers: customRequestHeaders: X-Forwarded-Proto: https X-Forwarded-Host: domain.org X-Forwarded-Uri: / app-middleware: forwardAuth: address: \"http://192.168.140.93:4180 # gatekeeper container address ##################### services: app-service: loadBalancer: servers: - url: \"http://192.168.x.x:80\" # App container address passHostHeader: true app-proxy: loadBalancer: servers: - url: \"http://192.168.x.x:4180\" # Gatekeeper container address passHostHeader: true nginx forward-auth configuration, nginx is more strict than traefik and rejects redirects, so in this case redirection to authorization server can be done only on nginx, example:\nnginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: | auth_request /auth; nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/server-snippet: | location ^~ /auth { internal; proxy_pass \u003cgatekeeper-url\u003e/$request_uri; proxy_pass_request_body off; proxy_set_header Content-Length \"\"; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Method $request_method; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-URI $request_uri; proxy_busy_buffers_size 64k; proxy_buffers 8 32k; proxy_buffer_size 32k; } gatekeeper configuration, must be --no-proxy=true with --no-redirects=true\nCustom pages By default, Gatekeeper Proxy will immediately redirect you for authentication and hand back a 403 for access denied. Most users will probably want to present the user with a more friendly sign-in and access denied page. You can pass the command line options (or via config file) paths to the files with --sign-in-page=PATH. The sign-in page will have a ‘redirect’ variable passed into the scope and holding the OAuth redirection URL. If you wish to pass additional variables into the templates, such as title, sitename and so on, you can use the --tags key=pair option, like this: --tags title=\"This is my site\" and the variable would be accessible from {{ .title }}.\n\u003chtml\u003e \u003cbody\u003e \u003ca href=\"{{ .redirect }}\"\u003eSign-in\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/body\u003e \u003c/html\u003e Custom Error Page for Bad Request One use case for this is that: inside keycloak server have “required user actions” set to “Terms and Conditions”. That means, if it is the first time an user access app X, he will need to accept the T\u0026C or decline. If he accepts the terms, he can login fine to app X. However, if he declines it, he gets an empty error page with “bad request”.\nYou can use built-in template or your custom:\n--error-page=templates/error.html.tmpl White-listed URL’s Depending on how the application URL’s are laid out, you might want protect the root / URL but have exceptions on a list of paths, for example /health. While this is best solved by adjusting the paths, you can add exceptions to the protected resources, like this:\nresources: - uri: /some_white_listed_url white-listed: true - uri: /* methods: - GET roles: - \u003cCLIENT_APP_NAME\u003e:\u003cROLE_NAME\u003e - \u003cCLIENT_APP_NAME\u003e:\u003cROLE_NAME\u003e Or on the command line\n--resources \"uri=/some_white_listed_url|white-listed=true\" --resources \"uri=/*\" # requires authentication on the rest --resources \"uri=/admin*|roles=admin,superuser|methods=POST,DELETE\" PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) Gatekeeper supports PKCE with S256 code challenge method. It stores code verifier in cookie. You can set custom cookie name with --cookie-pkce-name.\nMutual TLS The proxy support enforcing mutual TLS for the clients by adding the --tls-ca-certificate command line option or configuration file option. All clients connecting must present a certificate that was signed by the CA being used.\nCertificate rotation The proxy will automatically rotate the server certificates if the files change on disk. Note, no downtime will occur as the change is made inline. Clients who connected before the certificate rotation will be unaffected and will continue as normal with all new connections presented with the new certificate.\nRefresh tokens If a request for an access token contains a refresh token and --enable-refresh-tokens is set to true, the proxy will automatically refresh the access token for you. The tokens themselves are kept either as an encrypted (--encryption-key=KEY) cookie (cookie name: kc-state). or a store (still requires encryption key).\nTo enable a local Redis store use redis://user:secret@localhost:6379/0?protocol=3. See redis-uri specification In both cases, the refresh token is encrypted before being placed into the store.\nPost Login Redirect Without this option if user comes to site protected by gatekeeper e.g. http://somesite/somepath, user will be redirected to login and after login back to http://somesite/path. If user comes to / before login he will be redirected back to /. Sometimes you want redirect user back not to / but some path. For this there is option --post-login-redirect-path=/fallback/path which enables you to define some path to which user will be redirected after login if user comes to root path /.\nLogout endpoint There are 2 possibilities how to logout:\nUsing gatekeeper own mechanism --enable-logout-redirect=false In this case calling /oauth/logout will use revocation endpoint which might be set by option --revocation-url or if not set it will be retrieved from keycloak OpenID discovery response https://keycloak.example.com/realms/REALM_NAME/protocol/openid-connect/revoke. By default it will try to retrieve token from authorization header or access token cookie and then token from refresh token cookie, if latter present it will be used for revocation, if not first will be used. If access token is passed to revocation endpoint it will only revoke that access token, so on next request with refresh token user will get new access token. If refresh token is passed to revocation endpoint it will revoke refresh token and all access tokens. Thus it is recommended to pass refresh tokens, this means for --no-redirects=false (code flow) you should enable refresh tokens --enable-refresh-tokens=true so that refresh cookie will be passed to endpoint. For --no-redirects=true you have to pass refresh token in authorization header.\nPost Logout Redirection - redirection url will be gathered from this places from highest priority to lowest:\n–post-logout-redirect-uri option - recommended /oauth/logout?redirect=url - from redirect url query parameter, not recommended, kept only for convenience –redirection-url option Using keycloak mechanism, valid only for keycloak 18+ --enable-logout-redirect=true Uses keycloak logout endpoint https://keycloak.example.com/realms/REALM_NAME/protocol/openid-connect/logout.\nPost Logout Redirection - you can specify url in --post-logout-redirect-uri option, this logout mechanism uses id token for logging out, in case of code flow this is gathered automatically from id token cookie. In case of --no-redirects=true you have to pass id token in authorization header.\nSession logout Many times there are cases when you have multiple applications (multiple keycloak clients for gatekeeper) and you would like to achieve that logout on one application causes logout also on other application. For this use case there is option --enable-idp-session-check=true together with --enable-logout-redirect=true.\nCross-origin resource sharing (CORS) You can add a CORS header via the --cors-[method] with these configuration options.\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin\nAccess-Control-Allow-Methods\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers\nAccess-Control-Expose-Headers\nAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials\nAccess-Control-Max-Age\nYou can add using the config file:\ncors-origins: - '*' cors-methods: - GET - POST or via the command line:\n--cors-origins [--cors-origins option] a set of origins to add to the CORS access control (Access-Control-Allow-Origin) --cors-methods [--cors-methods option] the method permitted in the access control (Access-Control-Allow-Methods) --cors-headers [--cors-headers option] a set of headers to add to the CORS access control (Access-Control-Allow-Headers) --cors-exposes-headers [--cors-exposes-headers option] set the expose cors headers access control (Access-Control-Expose-Headers) Upstream URL You can control the upstream endpoint via the --upstream-url option. Both HTTP and HTTPS are supported with TLS verification and keep-alive support configured via the --skip-upstream-tls-verify / --upstream-keepalives option. Note, the proxy can also upstream via a UNIX socket, --upstream-url unix://path/to/the/file.sock.\nEndpoints /oauth/authorize is authentication endpoint which will generate the OpenID redirect to the provider\n/oauth/callback is provider OpenID callback endpoint\n/oauth/expired is a helper endpoint to check if a access token has expired, 200 for ok and, 401 for no token and 401 for expired\n/oauth/health is the health checking endpoint for the proxy, you can also grab version from headers\n/oauth/login provides a relay endpoint to login via grant_type=password, for example, POST /oauth/login form values are username=USERNAME\u0026password=PASSWORD (must be enabled)\n/oauth/logout provides a convenient endpoint to log the user out, it will always attempt to perform a back channel log out of offline tokens\n/oauth/token is a helper endpoint which will display the current access token for you\n/oauth/metrics is a Prometheus metrics handler\n/oauth/discovery provides endpoint with basic urls gatekeeper provides\nLevel Of Authentication (Application Context Class Reference - ACR) Level Of Authentication or Step up authentication enables to raise required level of authentication while accessing certain resources. For setting up please first check keycloak documentation https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#_step-up-flow. To configure it on gatekeeper side you will need to use option --enable-loa=true and configure resources:\n--resources=uri=/cats|acr=level1,level2 --resources=uri=/pets|acr=level2 This example configures two URIs, first /cats accepts two level of authentications level1 or level2, in case token doesn’t contain any of these levels, it redirects to authentication and uses first one level1 as default one. Second URI /pets accepts one level of authentication level2. In case token contains level1 it redirets to authentication using level2 acr value.\nExternal Authorization Open Policy Agent (OPA) authorization In version 1.8.8 we are introducing external authorization with OPA (applicable to auth code flow --no-redirects=false as well as for --no-redirects=true). Gatekeeper sends request with this structure to OPA for authorization:\n{ \"input\": { \"body\": \"{\\\"name\\\": \\\"test\\\"}\" // body is sent as string so you will have to unmarshal it in case of json/yaml in OPA \"headers\": { \"X-SOME\": [\"some value\", \"other value\"], }, \"host\": \"some.com\", \"protocol\": \"HTTP/1.1\", \"path\": \"/test\", \"remote_addr\": \"192.168.1.90\", \"method\": \"POST\", \"user_agent\": \"Firefox\", } } Example gatekeeper configuration:\nenable-opa: true enable-default-deny: true opa-timeout: \"60s\" opa-authz-uri: \"http://127.0.0.1/v1/data/authz/allow\" Example OPA policy, with upper gatekeeper configuration and request would result allowing request to upstream:\npackage authz default allow := false body := json.unmarshal(input.body) allow { body.name = \"test\" body.method = \"POST\" } Keycloak authorization (UMA) Gatekeeper has ability of external authorization with keycloak using --enable-uma option for browser flows and also api flows. You have to also either populate resources or use --enable-default-deny (see examples in previous sections). So you can mix both external authorization+static resource permissions, but we don’t recommend it to not overcomplicate setup. First is always external authorization then static resource authorization. As it is new feature please don’t use it in production, we would like first to receive feedback/testing by community. Right now we use external authorization options provided by Keycloak which are specified in UMA (user managed access specification UMA). To use this feature you MUST execute these actions in keycloak:\nenable authorization for client in keycloak (client which you will use in gatekeeper) in client authorization tab, you MUST have at least one protected resource protected resource MUST have User-Managed Access enabled protected resource MUST have at least one authorization scope protected resource MUST have proper permissions set Example Keycloak Authorization Guide.\nExample Browser Flow: --discovery-url=\u003cDISCOVERY_URL\u003e --openid-provider-timeout=120s --listen=0.0.0.0:3000 --client-id=\u003cCLIENT_ID\u003e --client-secret=\u003cCLIENT_SECRET\u003e --upstream-url=\u003cUPSTREAM_URL\u003e # code flow/browser flow --no-redirects=false # you have to set this or resources=/* to have enable-uma working --enable-default-deny=true # we are enabling UMA --enable-uma=true # we are also enabling using method scope, this is optional, # it will check resource in keycloak not just for accessed URL # but also for method scope e.g. method:GET, it will return # UMA token in cookie only for that URL+method scope, # if you don't turn it on it will check just for URL # and will return UMA token in cookie # with all scopes --enable-uma-method-scope=true # UMA token is stored in cookie, you can setup custom name # by default cookie name is uma_token --cookie-uma-name=\u003cCUSTOM_COOKIE_NAME\u003e --skip-access-token-clientid-check=true --skip-access-token-issuer-check=true --openid-provider-retry-count=30 NOTE: You can have only one resource with same URL+method scope combination or URL (in case you don’t have method scope enabled), if you have more your access will be forbidden\nExample API Flow: we are recommending to use UMA forward signing for these purpose on client app side, otherwise you will have to get RPT token for client side manually. On client app side, forward signing setup (you app should have http proxy options set to this forward-signing proxy):\n--discovery-url=\u003cDISCOVERY_URL\u003e --openid-provider-timeout=120s --listen=0.0.0.0:3000 --client-id=\u003cCLIENT_ID\u003e --client-secret=\u003cCLIENT_SECRET\u003e --enable-uma=true --enable-uma-method-scope=true --enable-forwarding=true # you can use client credentials grant or direct access grant # see Forward-signing proxy section --forwarding-grant-type=client_credentials --skip-access-token-clientid-check=true --skip-access-token-issuer-check=true --openid-provider-retry-count=30 On server side, UMA in no-redirects mode:\n--discovery-url=\u003cDISCOVERY_URL\u003e --openid-provider-timeout=120s --listen=0.0.0.0:3000 --client-id=\u003cCLIENT_ID\u003e --client-secret=\u003cCLIENT_SECRET\u003e --upstream-url=\u003cUPSTREAM_URL\u003e # api flow --no-redirects=true # you have to set this or resources=/* to have enable-uma working --enable-default-deny=true # we are enabling UMA --enable-uma=true # we are also enabling using method scope, this is optional, # it will check resource in keycloak not just for accessed URL # but also for method scope e.g. method:GET, it will return # UMA token in cookie only for that URL+method scope, # if you don't turn it on it will check just for URL # and will return UMA token in cookie # with all scopes --enable-uma-method-scope=true --skip-access-token-clientid-check=true --skip-access-token-issuer-check=true --openid-provider-retry-count=30 Request tracing Usually when there are multiple http services involved in serving user requests you need to use X-REQUEST-ID or some other header to track request flow through services. To make this possible with gatekeeper you can enable header logging by enabling --enable-logging and --verbose options. Also you can use request-id-header and enable-request-id options, which will generate unique uuid and will inject in header supplied in request-id-header option.\nLogs and GDPR You can enable/disable logging by specifying --enable-logging option. This will log all messages with info log level and higher. It will NOT log any personal sensitive information, like client IP or user email. When you would like to see debug messages you need to use --verbose=true option.\nIMPORTANT: debug messages WILL contain personal information, for easier debugging\nMetrics Assuming --enable-metrics has been set, a Prometheus endpoint can be found on /oauth/metrics; at present the only metric being exposed is a counter per HTTP code.\nLimitations Keep in mind browser cookie limits if you use access or refresh tokens in the browser cookie. Gatekeeper Proxy divides the cookie automatically if your cookie is longer than 4093 bytes. The real size of the cookie depends on the content of the issued access token. Also, encryption might add additional bytes to the cookie size. If you have large cookies (\u003e200 KB), you might reach browser cookie limits.\nAll cookies are part of the header request, so you might find a problem with the max headers size limits in your infrastructure (some load balancers have very low this value, such as 8 KB). Be sure that all network devices have sufficient header size limits. Otherwise, your users won’t be able to obtain an access token.\nKnown Issues There WAS a known issue with the Keycloak server 4.6.0.Final in which Gatekeeper Proxy is unable to find the client_id in the aud claim. This is due to the fact the client_id is not in the audience anymore. The workaround is to add the “Audience” protocol mapper to the client with the audience pointed to the client_id. For more information, see KEYCLOAK-8954.\nyou can now use --skip-access-token-clientid-check and --skip-access-token-issuer-check to overcome this limitations. These are now set by default to true so you should not by default see any these issues, but in case you would like to enable this checks you still have opportunity.",
